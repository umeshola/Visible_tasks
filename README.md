#About the Project
This is a project that demonstrates how to work with a blockchain network and how to connect contracts with React.
It is a simple Todo app which has two sections:
Private Todos
These todos are related to each account address and are only visible to the user who created them.
Public Todos
These todos are visible to everyone using the network.
